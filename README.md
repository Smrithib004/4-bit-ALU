# 4-bit-ALU
Designed and implemented a 4-bit ALU that performed ADD, SUB, XNOR, ROR, ROL using a control MUX in Cadence Virtuoso. Performed the same using Verilog HDL for implementation and simulation in ModelSim.
Full design of all blocks and overall circuit in Virtuoso and full code covered in the report file.
